sql2doxygen v0.2 [Alpha]
========================

Introduction
------------

Doxygen is a tool for generating documentation from source code and it
currently handles many languages either natively or through add-on filters.
This script is one such filter that transforms T-SQL into C-like code so that
Doxygen can then parse it natively. 

While this means that you can benefit from the automated generation of
documentation it does mean that you have to mentally translate a 'struct' back
into a 'table' and reverse the type and member/variable names in declarations.

Documentation
-------------

There is a manual: sql2doxygen.html.
