<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen </a>is a tool for generating documentation
from source code and it currently handles many languages either natively or
through add-on filters. This script is one such filter that transforms T-SQL
into C-like code so that Doxygen can then parse it natively.
</p><p>
While this means that you can benefit from the automated generation of
documentation it does mean that you have to mentally translate a 'struct' back
into a 'table' and reverse the type and member/variable names in declarations.
</p><p>
There is a <a href="http://github.com/paulpster/sqlDoxygen">separate project
underway</a> that is designed to allow Doxygen to natively handle SQL and format
it in a fashion more suitable for SQL databases.
</p>

<a name="Installation"></a>
<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
The only file you need from the package is <code>sql2doxygen.ps1</code>. Copy
it to somewhere suitable such as your Doxygen installation or the SQL project.
</p><p>
In the Doxygen configuration file for your project you'll find a section about
options for input files. Near the bottom of that section you'll find an entry
called <code>INPUT_FILTER</code>, set this to where the <code>sql2doxygen.ps1</code>
script lives.
</p><pre>
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT        = .
. . .
INPUT_FILTER = "PowerShell.exe -File C:\Path\To\sql2doxygen.ps1"
. . .
</pre><p>
The surrounding quotes are required or you'll get a cryptic error from
Doxygen about not being able to find it.
</p>

<a name="Exmaple"></a>
<h4>Example Output</h4>

<p>
In the package you'll find a subfolder called <code>Example</code> that contains
a Doxygen project file and a few .sql files. Assuming the Doxygen .exe is on your
path and the location is writable you can generate the example output like so:-
</p><pre>
C:\sql2doxygen\Example> doxygen.exe Doxygen.cfg
</pre><p>
You should see a new folder appear called <code>Dox</code>. Open <code>index.html</code>
to see the results:-
</p><pre>
C:\sql2doxygen\Example> start Dox\index.html
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The example Doxygen.cfg file uses a relative path to reference the sql2doxygen
filter script and so you must ensure the current working directory (CWD) is set
to the <code>Example</code> folder.
</p>

<a name="Formatting"></a>
<h4>SQL Source Formatting</h4>

<p>
The filter is implemented as a very simple line-based parser and that means
there are restrictions on how freely the SQL can be formatted. Basically each
part of the declaration (table name, column, parameter, etc.) should be on a
separate line. If you document your columns and parameters using the single-line
comment style on the right hand side this will be natural anyway.
</p>

<h5>Comment Formats</h5>
<p>
T-SQL supports the C-style multi-line comment style <code>/* comment */</code>
and its own single-line style <code>-- comment</code>. This means that the
first style is already supported directly by Doxygen, whereas the second is
easily translated into the C++ style <code>// comment</code>. Below are a few
examples of Doxygen enabled SQL comments:-
</p><pre>
/**
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 */

/** This is a comment on one line. */

/*! This is an alternate C-style comment. */

--! The is the SQL equivalent of a C++ single-line comment

--- This is the alternate style of single-line comment

definition_1    /*!< This comment is to the right */
definition_2    --!< This comment is also to the right
definition_3    ---< Another comment to the right
</pre>
<p>
Non-Doxygen enabled comments (/* */ and --) are still supported and will
be passed through the filter but ignored by Doxygen.
</p>

<h5>Identifier Format</h5>
<p>
The filter recognises identifiers surrounded by []'s and also detects the schema
name if present. The schema will be translated into a namespace and any characters
in the name unsupported by C will be stripped or replaced with an '_'.
</p><pre>
CREATE TABLE [staging].[Customer]
</pre><p>
Will be translated to:-
</p><pre>
struct staging::Customer
</pre>

<h5>Table Format</h5>
<p>
Tables are translated into C 'structs' with the columns being represented as
fields (or members). The only aspects of the column definition that are passed
through are the type and name; additional attributes and constraints are ignored.
The following example uses comments that precede the columns:-
</p><pre>
/*!
 * This table is an example.
 */

CREATE TABLE schema.MyTable
(
    /*! My first column */
    Column_1 int not null primary key clustered,

    --! My second column
    Column_2 udt.MyType 
);
</pre><p>
This example shows the use of comments to the right of the columns:-
</p><pre>
--!
--! This table is also an example.
--!

CREATE TABLE schema.MyTable
(
    Column_1 int,          /*!< My first column */
    Column_2 udt.MyType    --!< My second column
);
</pre><p>
The body must be enclosed in parenthesis on separate lines but the trailing
semi-colon is optional.
</p>

<h5>Stored Procedure Format</h5>
<p>
Stored procedures are transformed into C functions with the type and variable
names switched around. Once again you can place the comment before or to the
right of the argument, but they must be on separate lines. The body is denoted
by the AS/GO pair which is transformed into a pair of curly braces.
</p><pre>
/*!
 * A stored procedure that does stuff.
 */

CREATE PROCEDURE MyStoredProcedure
(
    @value1	tinyint,        --!< The 1st argument.
    @value2	varchar(10)     /*!< The 2nd argument. */
)
AS
    . . .
GO
</pre><p>
The arguments must be enclosed in parenthesis and both the parenthesis and
AS/GO body delimiters must be on separate lines.
</p>

<h5>Function Format</h5>
<p>
Functions are handled in much the same way as stored procedures, but with the
addition of the return type. Due to the return type being specified after the
argument list there are a few styles of function that can be used depending
on whether the function takes zero or more arguments:-
</p><pre>
CREATE FUNCTION MyFunction() RETURNS tinyint
AS
    . . .
GO

CREATE FUNCTION MyFunction()
    RETURNS tinyint
AS
    . . .
GO

CREATE FUNCTION MyFunction
(
)
    RETURNS tinyint
AS
    . . .
GO

CREATE FUNCTION MyFunction
(
    @value1	tinyint,        --!< The 1st argument.
    @value2	varchar(10)     /*!< The 2nd argument. */
)
    RETURNS tinyint
AS
    . . .
GO
</pre><p>
As with stored procedures the arguments must be enclosed in parenthesis and both
the parenthesis and AS/GO body delimiters must be on separate lines.
